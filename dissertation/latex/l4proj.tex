%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count.
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document.
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 20 pages for a
% 20 credit report. This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.
%
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
%
%
%==================================================================================================================================
%
% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if
% it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion,
% however.

\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}

We present background information for the project, with discussion of Access Control systems and Encryption methods, as well as the concept of Public Key Infrastructures. We further present the uses \& requirements of Resource Servers, along with identifying an \acrshort{abe} tool for the system; the \OpenABE library.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:bkgr_summary}

Having discussed the pros and cons of an Access Control system, and establishing that at-rest encryption was an absolute requirement for the \theResServer system, the project identified \acrfull{abe} as an ideal method of encrypting resources securely, whilst offering the granularity in access policies that \acrfull{abac} provides.

The choice of \acrshort{abe} ensured that the system would not have to implement a Public Key Infrastructure for distributing private keys and would be able to offer all the services that would be expected of a resource server, securely.

Lastly, the project identified the \OpenABE library as a perfect candidate for integrating as the system's \acrshort{abe} library, due to its track record; deployed as a hospital medical record system \citep{Akinyele2011}.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Analysis/Requirements}
\label{ch:analysis}

The \theResServer system would require the defining of two servers: an offline \acrfull{mks} tasked with provisioning the master private key and subsequent user keys, and a separate \acrfull{prs} for storing all encrypted resources. An end user product would also be required, to run locally on a user's device and then connect to the \acrshort{prs} to provide the services on offer through a simple \acrshort{gui}, shown in \Cref{fig:deployment_abbrv2_diagram}.

\begin{figure}[htp]

  \caption{A second, high-level diagram of the \acrshort{dcs} \theResServer system.}

  \label{fig:deployment_abbrv2_diagram}
\end{figure}

We present the analysis of the deployment scenario and the identified requirements of the \theResServer system along with the enrolment process for new users. From analysis of the \acrfull{dcs} we also present a set of Case Studies, considered by the project throughout design, implementation \& evaluation.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:analysis_summary}

With analysis of the \acrfull{dcs} deployment presented, we presented the security considerations of the \theResServer system, discussing the requirement of securing uploaded resources and the reasons the project selected \acrfull{abe} for this purpose, including the integration with \acrshort{abe}.

We also presented the individual security considerations of both the \acrfull{prs} and \acrfull{mks} in the context of the \acrshort{dcs}, along with the enrolment process for new users (accounting for the offline status of the \acrshort{mks}).

Finally, we described the six Case Studies for the \theResServer system and demonstrated the applicability of each study to the \acrshort{dcs}.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Design}
\label{ch:design}

With Background (\Cref{ch:background}) and Analysis (\Cref{ch:analysis}) presented, we present the design of the \theResServer system and the design requirements for the different aspects of the system.\\
This includes the formal language definition (\Cref{sec:formal_lang}) for \theResServer system's policy language, \thePolicyLang, the design of the system's User Keys (\Cref{sec:design_user_key}) and the System Architecture (\Cref{sec:design_sys_arch}). Further, we present the design of the Policy Building (\Cref{sec:design_pol_build}) \& Filename Searching (\Cref{sec:design_file_search}) tools to be incorporated into the \acrfull{crs}.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:design_summary}

We have presented the design of the \theResServer system, with a breakdown of the required software and the formal definition of a policy language, \thePolicyLang, that defines the types and syntax for \acrfull{abe} policies. We have also demonstrated use of \thePolicyLang to construct policies for 2 Case Studies \textit{(the remaining 4 Case Study policies are presented in Appendices \ref{appendix:case_study_0_policy}\textemdash\ref{appendix:case_study_4_policy})} and the process for users building new policies.

Finally, we discussed the user key design and system architecture for the \theResServer system, and described the design of a search utility for the \acrfull{prs} to enable users to discover resources.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}

From the designs in \Cref{ch:design}, we present the implementation of the \theResServer system. With the \acrfull{mks}, \acrfull{prs} \& \acrfull{crs} implemented as web servers built from Python's Flask microframework using the \PyOpenABE library for \acrfull{abe}. The \acrshort{prs} implements filename searching and uses a local database for storing resource metadata.

\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

Evaluation of the project is presented in the form of a risk assessment, verifying the security of the project and a discussion of the project achievements, with reference to the Case Studies designed in \Cref{sec:analysis_case_studies} that provide evidence that the system produced meets the needs of the users in the \acrfull{dcs}.
