We will also present the advantages of using a non-relational database compared to a relational database, integrated in a forum in the field of personal and professional development. The NoSQL database used to develop the forum is MongoDB, and was chosen from a variety of non-relational databases, thanks to some aspects that we will highlight in this article.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the asymmetric key algorithms, beginning from the inception of asymmetric cryptography in 1976 till the present day. This paper provides a description of their encryption and decryption operations, points out their security basis, areas of implementation, their strengths and weaknesses during operation. Finally, the paper pinpoints the existing gap based on conclusions drawn from the review, with particular emphasis on an algorithm most suited for industrial application given the current trends in cryptography towards quantum computing. This paper then narrows down on the earnest need for an algorithm that has no trade-off in encryption and decryption speeds, has low computation overhead and is secure enough to withstand quantum algorithm attacks.},

abstract = {We always hear some statements like 'SQL is outdated', 'This is the world of NoSQL', 'SQL is still used a lot by most of companies.' Which one is accurate? Has NoSQL completely replace SQL? Or is NoSQL just a hype? SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard query language for relational database management system. The most popular types of RDBMS(Relational Database Management Systems) like Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, uses SQL as their standard database query language.[3] NoSQL means Not Only SQL, which is a collection of non-relational data storage systems. The important character of NoSQL is that it relaxes one or more of the ACID properties for a better performance in desired fields. Some of the NOSQL databases most companies using are Cassandra, CouchDB, Hadoop Hbase, MongoDB. In this paper, we'll outline the general differences between the SQL and NoSQL, discuss if Relational Database Management Systems is a thing of past, and also compare the speed performance of SQL and NoSQL databases, such as BerkeleyDB, MongoDB and MySQL.},

abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

abstract = {Secure instant messaging is utilized in two variants: one-to-one communication and group communication. While the first variant has received much attention lately (Frosch et al., EuroS{\&}P16; Cohn-Gordon et al., EuroS{\&}P17; Kobeissi et al., EuroS{\&}P17), little is known about the cryptographic mechanisms and security guarantees of secure group communication in instant messaging. To approach an investigation of group instant messaging protocols, we first provide a comprehensive and realistic security model. This model combines security and reliability goals from various related literature to capture relevant properties for communication in dynamic groups. Thereby the definitions consider their satisfiability with respect to the instant delivery of messages. To show its applicability, we analyze three widely used real-world protocols: Signal, WhatsApp, and Threema. Since these protocols and their implementations are mostly undocumented for the public and two out of three applications among them are closed source, we describe the group protocols employed in Signal, WhatsApp, and Threema. By applying our model, we reveal several shortcomings with respect to the security definition. Therefore we propose generic countermeasures to enhance the protocols regarding the required security and reliability goals. Our systematic analysis reveals that (1) the communications' integrity – represented by the integrity of all exchanged messages – and (2) the groups' closeness – represented by the members' ability of managing the group – are not end-to-end protected. We additionally show that strong security properties, such as Future Secrecy which is a core part of the one-to-one communication in the Signal protocol, do not hold for its group communication.},

Although many well-studied techniques exist for authentication, Web sites continue to use extremely weak authentication schemes, especially in non-enterprise environments such as store fronts. These weaknesses often result from careless use of authenticators within Web cookies. Of the twenty-seven sites we investigated, we weakened the client authentication on two systems, gained unauthorized access on eight, and extracted the secret key used to mint authenticators from one. We provide a description of the limitations, requirements, and security models speciﬁc to Web client authentication. This includes the introduction of the interrogative adversary, a surprisingly powerful adversary that can adaptively query a Web site. We propose a set of hints for designing a secure client authentication scheme. Using these hints, we present the design and analysis of a simple authentication scheme secure against forgeries by the interrogative adversary.

abstract = {Security is always a major concern in the field of communication. Advanced encryption standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithms are the two popular encryption schemes that guarantee confidentiality and authenticity over an insecure communication channel. There has been trifling cryptanalytic progress against these two algorithms since their advent. This paper presents the fundamental mathematics behind the AES and RSA algorithm along with a brief description of some cryptographic primitives that are commonly used in the field of communication security. It also includes several computational issues as well as the analysis of AES and RSA security aspects against different kinds of attacks including the countermeasures against these attacks.},

The report sets out examples of good practice in relation to risk assessment, and contrasts these with pitfalls encountered by HSE, illustrated by case study examples.
