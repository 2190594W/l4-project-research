abstract = {The enormous growth in the diversity of content ser-vices such as IPtv has highlighted the inadequacy of the accompanying content security: existing security mecha-nisms scale poorly, require complex and often costly dedi-cated hardware, or fail to meet basic security requirements. New security methods are needed. In this paper, we ex-plore the ability of attribute-based encryption (ABE) to meet the unique performance and security requirements of con-ditional access systems such as subscription radio and pay-per-view television. We show through empirical study that costs of ABE make its direct application inappropriate, but present constructions that mitigate its incumbent costs. We develop an extensive simulation that allows us to explore the performance of a number of virtual hardware configu-rations and construction parameters over workloads devel-oped from real subscription and television audiences. These simulations show that we can securely deliver high qual-ity content to viewerships of the highest rated shows being broadcast today, some in excess of 26,000,000 viewers. It is through these experiments that we expose the viability of not only ABE-based content delivery, but applicability of ABE systems to large-scale distributed systems.},

abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a new vision for public key encryption that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages based on user attributes. For example, a user can create a ciphertext that can be decrypted only by other users with attributes satisfying ("Faculty" OR ("PhD Student" AND "Quals Completed")). Given its expressiveness, ABE is currently being considered for many cloud storage and computing applications. However, one of the main efficiency drawbacks of ABE is that the size of the ciphertext and the time required to decrypt it grows with the complexity of the access formula. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for ABE that largely eliminates this overhead for users. Suppose that ABE ciphertexts are stored in the cloud. We show how a user can provide the cloud with a single transformation key that allows the cloud to translate any ABE ciphertext satisfied by that user's attributes into a (constant-size) El Gamal-style ciphertext, without the cloud being able to read any part of the user's messages. To precisely define and demonstrate the advantages of this approach, we provide new security definitions for both CPA and replayable CCA security with outsourcing, several new constructions, an implementation of our algorithms and detailed performance measurements. In a typical configuration, the user saves significantly on both bandwidth and decryption time, without increasing the number of transmissions.},

abstract = {We introduce a new type of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) scheme that we call Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption. In Fuzzy IBE we view an identity as set of descriptive attributes. A Fuzzy IBE scheme allows for a private key for an identity, $\omega$, to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with an identity, $\omega$?, if and only if the identities $\omega$ and $\omega$? are close to each other as measured by the “set overlap” distance metric. A Fuzzy IBE scheme can be applied to enable encryption using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy IBE scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-IBE can be used for a type of application that we term “attribute-based encryption”. In this paper we present two constructions of Fuzzy IBE schemes. Our constructions can be viewed as an Identity-Based Encryption of a message under several attributes that compose a (fuzzy) identity. Our IBE schemes are both error-tolerant and secure against collusion attacks. Additionally, our basic construction does not use random oracles. We prove the security of our schemes under the Selective-ID security model.},

The characteristics of access control in an enterprise environment are examined and a task-role-based access control (T-RBAC) model founded on concept of classification of tasks is introduced. Task is a fundamental unit of business work or business activity T-RBAC deals with each task differently according to its class, and supports task level access control and supervision role hierarchy.

Of the twenty-seven sites we investigated, we weakened the client authentication on two systems, gained unauthorized access on eight, and extracted the secret key used to mint authenticators from one. We provide a description of the limitations, requirements, and security models speciﬁc to Web client authentication.

Our system allows healthcare organizations to export EMRs to locations outside of their trust boundary. In contrast to previous approaches, our solution is designed to maintain EMR availability even when providers are offline, i.e., where network connectivity is not available. To balance the needs of emergency care and patient privacy, our system is designed to provide fine-grained encryption and is able to protect individual items within an EMR, where each encrypted item may have its own access control policy. We implemented a prototype system using a new key- and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption library that we developed. Our implementation, which includes an iPhone app for storing and managing EMRs offline, allows for flexible and automated policy generation. An evaluation of our design shows that our ABE library performs well, has acceptable storage requirements, and is practical and usable on modern smartphones.},

Our solutions allow any encryptor to specify access control in terms of any access formula over the attributes in the system. In our most efficient system, ciphertext size, encryption, and decryption time scales linearly with the complexity of the access formula. The only previous work to achieve these parameters was limited to a proof in the generic group model. We present three constructions within our framework. Our first system is proven selectively secure under a assumption that we call the decisional Parallel Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent (PBDHE) assumption which can be viewed as a generalization of the BDHE assumption. Our next two constructions provide performance tradeoffs to achieve provable security respectively under the (weaker) decisional Bilinear-Diffie-Hellman Exponent and decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumptions.},
