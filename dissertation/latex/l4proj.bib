abstract = {ABSTRACTThis work describes the analysis, design, and implementation of a secure scheme for storage, retrieval, and fine-grained sharing of digital documents in cloud computing using mobile devices. Confidentiality of digital documents stored in public clouds from a mobile device is achieved by implementing the digital envelope concept. Data are encrypted using AES, and the session key is encrypted using ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE). CP-ABE also provides access control mechanisms at a fine-grain level, allowing the decryption of the AES key only to those users having the correct set of attributes. The encryption and decryption processes are carried out in a mobile device that interacts with a cloud provider, a trust server, and a key server. For practical implementation of CP-ABE, the Tate pairing was used on elliptic curves type A and F over prime fields, using affine and projective coordinates for the security levels 80, 112, and 128 bits. After evaluating the proposed system for different CP-ABE implementation options, it was observed that the elliptic curves type A allow execution times 18 times faster compared with the use of elliptic curves type F, achieving processing times that ensures the deployment of the proposed secure scheme.

@article{Traynor2008,
abstract = {The enormous growth in the diversity of content ser-vices such as IPtv has highlighted the inadequacy of the accompanying content security: existing security mecha-nisms scale poorly, require complex and often costly dedi-cated hardware, or fail to meet basic security requirements. New security methods are needed. In this paper, we ex-plore the ability of attribute-based encryption (ABE) to meet the unique performance and security requirements of con-ditional access systems such as subscription radio and pay-per-view television. We show through empirical study that costs of ABE make its direct application inappropriate, but present constructions that mitigate its incumbent costs. We develop an extensive simulation that allows us to explore the performance of a number of virtual hardware configu-rations and construction parameters over workloads devel-oped from real subscription and television audiences. These simulations show that we can securely deliver high qual-ity content to viewerships of the highest rated shows being broadcast today, some in excess of 26,000,000 viewers. It is through these experiments that we expose the viability of not only ABE-based content delivery, but applicability of ABE systems to large-scale distributed systems.},

@article{Waters2011,
abstract = {We present a new methodology for realizing Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Encryption (CP-ABE) under concrete and noninteractive cryptographic assumptions in the standard model. Our solutions allow any encryptor to specify access control in terms of any access formula over the attributes in the system. In our most efficient system, ciphertext size, encryption, and decryption time scales linearly with the complexity of the access formula. The only previous work to achieve these parameters was limited to a proof in the generic group model. We present three constructions within our framework. Our first system is proven selectively secure under a assumption that we call the decisional Parallel Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent (PBDHE) assumption which can be viewed as a generalization of the BDHE assumption. Our next two constructions provide performance tradeoffs to achieve provable security respectively under the (weaker) decisional Bilinear-Diffie-Hellman Exponent and decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumptions.},

@article{Green2011,
abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a new vision for public key encryption that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages based on user attributes. For example, a user can create a ciphertext that can be decrypted only by other users with attributes satisfying ("Faculty" OR ("PhD Student" AND "Quals Completed")). Given its expressiveness, ABE is currently being considered for many cloud storage and computing applications. However, one of the main efficiency drawbacks of ABE is that the size of the ciphertext and the time required to decrypt it grows with the complexity of the access formula. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for ABE that largely eliminates this overhead for users. Suppose that ABE ciphertexts are stored in the cloud. We show how a user can provide the cloud with a single transformation key that allows the cloud to translate any ABE ciphertext satisfied by that user's attributes into a (constant-size) El Gamal-style ciphertext, without the cloud being able to read any part of the user's messages. To precisely define and demonstrate the advantages of this approach, we provide new security definitions for both CPA and replayable CCA security with outsourcing, several new constructions, an implementation of our algorithms and detailed performance measurements. In a typical configuration, the user saves significantly on both bandwidth and decryption time, without increasing the number of transmissions.},

@article{Akinyele2011,
abstract = {We provide a design and implementation of self-protecting electronic medical records (EMRs) using attribute-based encryption on mobile devices. Our system allows healthcare organizations to export EMRs to locations outside of their trust boundary. In contrast to previous approaches, our solution is designed to maintain EMR availability even when providers are offline, i.e., where network connectivity is not available. To balance the needs of emergency care and patient privacy, our system is designed to provide fine-grained encryption and is able to protect individual items within an EMR, where each encrypted item may have its own access control policy. We implemented a prototype system using a new key- and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption library that we developed. Our implementation, which includes an iPhone app for storing and managing EMRs offline, allows for flexible and automated policy generation. An evaluation of our design shows that our ABE library performs well, has acceptable storage requirements, and is practical and usable on modern smartphones.},
