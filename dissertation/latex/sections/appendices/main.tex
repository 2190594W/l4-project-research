\section{Appendix A - Deployment Roles \& Users}
\label{appendix:roles_users}

\section{Appendix B - Enrolment Diagram for Staff User}
\label{appendix:enrolment_diagram}

\Cref{fig:appendix_sta_deployment} represents a deployment diagram for the \theResServer system, with staff member enrolling into the system. This diagram is an alternative to the student enrolment diagram in \Cref{fig:deployment_diagram}.

The staff member can be seen requesting a user key \#1 (and providing their staff username) from the \acrshort{dcs} Teaching Assistant, whom verifies the staff members's identity and then retrieves their details \#2 from the HR/Payroll system. The Teaching Assistant then processes the returned attributes \#5 for the Master Key Server, and then requests a new key \#6 by providing the student's attributes. The Master Key Server can be seen processing \#7 and then returning the newly generated key \#8 to the Teaching Assistant, whom finally provides the key to the staff member.

\section{Appendix C - System Architecture Diagram}
\label{appendix:architecture_diagram}

\Cref{fig:appendix_sys_arch_full} represents a system architecture diagram for the \theResServer system. This diagram is an alternative to the condensed system architecture diagram in \Cref{fig:sys_arch_abbrv}.

The \acrfull{mks} is shown in an offline state with access to a local copy of the \OpenABE library for provisioning the system \& generating user keys. The \acrfull{prs} is shown receiving offline updates from the \acrshort{mks}, managing a local database with resource metadata \& the associated resource storage and providing search, config and upload \& download interfaces for clients. The \acrfull{crs} is shown with local access to an \OpenABE library for encryption \& decryption and access to an abstract Authentication Service (such as the university's SSO system). The \acrshort{crs} also implements the search, config and upload \& download interfaces provided by the \acrshort{prs} and provides its own upload \& download, encrypt \& decrypt and resource search interfaces for the user.

\section{Electronic Appendices}
\label{appendix:electronic_appendices}

We make note of the Risk Assessment Excel document. Too large to submit within the dissertation, it is included in the submitted code file under: \texttt{l4-project-research/reports/RiskAssessment.xlsx}.
