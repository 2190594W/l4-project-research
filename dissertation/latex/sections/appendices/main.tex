    \caption{A sequence diagram demonstrating the enrolment process for a staff member. The staff member can be seen requesting a user key \#1 (and providing their staff username) from the \acrshort{dcs} Teaching Assistant, whom verifies the staff members's identity and then retrieves their details \#2 from the HR/Payroll system. The Teaching Assistant then processes the returned attributes \#5 for the Master Key Server, and then requests a new key \#6 by providing the student's attributes. The Master Key Server can be seen processing \#7 and then returning the newly generated key \#8 to the Teaching Assistant, whom finally provides the key to the staff member.}

    \caption{
      A full architecture diagram describing the system architecture of the \theResServer system.
      The \acrfull{mks} is shown in an offline state with access to a local copy of the \OpenABE library for provisioning the system \& generating user keys. The \acrfull{prs} is shown receiving offline updates from the \acrshort{mks}, managing a local database with resource metadata \& the associated resource storage and providing search, config and upload \& download interfaces for clients. The \acrfull{crs} is shown with local access to an \OpenABE library for encryption \& decryption and access to an abstract Authentication Service (such as the university's SSO system). The \acrshort{crs} also implements the search, config and upload \& download interfaces provided by the \acrshort{prs} and provides its own upload \& download, encrypt \& decrypt and resource search interfaces for the user.
