    \caption{A sequence diagram demonstrating the enrolment process for a student. The student can be seen requesting a user key \#1 (and providing their student ID) from the DCS Teaching Assitant, whom verifies the student's identity and then retrieves their details \#2 from the Student Centre (or MyCampus) system. The Teaching Assistant then processes the returned attributes \#5 for the Master Key Server, and then requests a new key \#6 by providing the student's attributes. The Master Key Server can be seen processing \#7 and then returning the newly generated key \#8 to the Teaching Assistant, whom finally provides the key to the student.}
