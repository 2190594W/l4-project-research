\section{Enrolment Requirements}
\label{sec:analysis_enrolment}

Following from \Cref{subsec:analysis_deployment_mks} and \Cref{subsec:analysis_deployment_iuk}, a \acrfull{dcs} user must enrol in the \theResServer system by physically visiting the Teaching Office and proving their identity to the Admin staff, shown in \Cref{fig:enrolment_diagram}. Staff and students would prove their identity with their respective campus ID card.

Thus, any member of the \acrfull{dcs} would be eligible for enrolment in the system. This process would be deliberately designed to be partly physical for the added security in transferring the user's new key via a physical storage medium (instead of an electronic transfer, such as email).

New members of the \acrshort{dcs} must already physically attend an appointment to activate their campus cards for access to \acrshort{dcs} buildings \& laboratories, as such this report suggests that the \theResServer enrolment be added to this process.
