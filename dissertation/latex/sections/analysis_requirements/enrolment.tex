\section{Enrolment Requirements}
\label{sec:analysis_enrolment}

Following from \cref{subsec:analysis_deployment_mks} and \cref{subsec:analysis_deployment_iuk}, a Department of Computing Science user must be able to enrol in the \theResServer system by physically visiting the Teaching Office and proving their identity to the Admin staff. Staff and students could prove their identity with their respective campus ID cards, with passports providing further evidence should the Admin staff require it.\\
Any member of the \acrfull{dcs} would be eligible for enrolment in the system as long as they were able to adequately prove their membership to the Admin staff. This process would be deliberately designed to be partly physical for the added security in transferring the user's new key via a physical storage medium (instead of an electronic system such as email) as well as aiding the identity verification process with the user's physical presence.\\
New members of the \acrshort{dcs} must already physically attend an appointment to activate their campus cards for access to \acrshort{dcs} buildings \& laboratories, meaning that the \theResServer enrolment could reasonably be added to this process for limited impact on new users. Current users would have to visit the Teaching Office to complete enrolment into the system, however appointments could be timetabled and managed to ensure the smallest possible impact on \acrshort{dcs} members.
