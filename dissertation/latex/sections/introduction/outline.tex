\section{Outline (SUPER ROUGH)}

\textbf{Background}\\
	Discusses access control \& encryption.\\
		\textit{Focuses on classical (1-to-1) vs. modern (1-to-many)}\\
	Dicusses public key infrastructure \& the resource server.\\
  Looks at the openabe library.\\
    \textit{ Focusing on the pyopenabe bindings}\\

\vskip 0.5em

\textbf{Analysis/Requirements}\\
  Discusses security considerations.\\
    \textit{Focuses on why resources need secured, why ABE is best for this \& what the ABE implementation must be able to do}\\
  Discusses deployment considerations/conditions.\\
    \textit{Focusing on assumed physical security of MK server \& issuing of user keys}
  Discusses enrolment requirements \& case studies.

\vskip 0.5em

\textbf{Design}\\
  Discusses design of the policy language.\\
    \textit{Focuses on how does it meet the case studies \& formal definition}\\
  Discusses user key design.\\
    \textit{Focuses on SSO login to provide attributes \& signed manually by 'cold' server - offline, then processed by admin staff}\\
  Discusses deployment scenario \& architecture diagrams.\\
    \textit{ Focuses how servers will communicate \& how user will interact}\\
  Discusses tool for building policies \& filename searching.

\textbf{Implementation}\\
  Discusses openabe library toolset.\\
    \textit{Discusses translating policy language to openabe compliant \& use of bindings}\\
  Discusses python flask to build servers.\\
    \textit{Discusses use of flask to build web servers \& provide simple GUIs}\\
  Discusses wraps the pyopenabe bindings for encryption/decryption \& python client server.\\
    \textit{Discusses local only \& insecure by design (stores plaintext user key in local DB)}\\
  Discusses mongoDB for storage.\\
    \textit{Discusses file metadata storage on res server with providing basic search functionality \& user data (incl. key) on local client}\\
  Discusses fuzzy finder for filename searching.

\vskip 0.5em

\textbf{Evaluation}\\
  Discusses security evaluation.\\
    \textit{Discusses risk assessment with assets \& risks \& measures \& analysis}\\
  Discusses successfully achieved.\\
    \textit{Discusses encrypt/decrypt resources \& issue user keys properly (JSON request to MK server) \& store on a resource server \& retrieve from server by search \& client tool to handle all above by GUI \& store issued \& attributes and types globally as a record \& local, proof-of-concept authentication system \& extraction from .cpabe, .key files with extract policy from .cpabe files \& extract user attributes from .key files}\\
  Discusses failed to achieve.\\
    \textit{Discusses CLI tool for encrypt/decrypt with pyopenabe bindings \& full compatibility with openabe library \& metadata header for files encrypted with toolset}

\vskip 0.5em

\textbf{Conclusion}\\
  Summarise.\\
  Confirm solution to original problem.\\
  Discuss future work.\\
  Dicusss problems (compatibility with openabe lib).\\
    \textit{Discusses extraction by regex issues}\\
  Discuss deployment.
