\begin{abstract}
  Development of a cryptographically secure resource server for staff \& students of the Department of Computing Science to distribute encrypted resources internally.\\
  Resources can be encrypted with unique, fine-grained policies of attributes that must then be resolved by an end user's private key in order to complete decryption.
  \vskip 0.5em
  Required the implementation and deployment of an Attribute-Based Encryption system built from a cryptographically-proven external library and designed with a complete enrolment process for generating \& signing user private keys securely.\\
  Requirements are proven by cryptographic mathematics, use-case based testing and a risk assessment of the system's deployment according to ISO 27005.
