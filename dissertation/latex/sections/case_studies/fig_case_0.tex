For this study the following details have been assumed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    the solutions were encrypted and then uploaded by the Admin staff member
  \item
    the staff member is Teresa Bonner with username `tbonner'
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.5em
With the details extracted, we can determine the attributes for the policy, where we define \textbf{\textit{Subject} s} and \textbf{\textit{Environment} e} as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[]
    \textbf{s} $\Rightarrow$ role, accountActiveUntil, username
  \item[]
    \textbf{e} $\Rightarrow$ currentDate
\end{itemize}

Applying the identified attributes for Case Study \#0 (\Cref{subsec:analysis_case_studies_0}) provides the policy in \cref{fig:case_study_policy_0} which would have been embedded in the encrypted lecture slides by the staff member before upload. The encrypted past paper can then remain stored on the server but only accessible to staff members and students.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\begin{align*}
  \text{Policy(\textbf{s},\textbf{e})}

    \text{username(\textbf{s})} \equiv \text{`tbonner'}

    \phantom{::}\vee
    \text{role(\textbf{s})} \equiv \text{`Staff'} \mid \text{`Student'}
  \\
  &
    \phantom{::}\wedge
    \text{accountActiveUntil(\textbf{s})} \geq \text{currentDate(\textbf{e})}
\end{align*}

    Case Study \#0 policy dictating access to a past exam paper.
    Successful decryption would be possible for the author of the slides (with username `tbonner') \textbf{or} any member of staff \textbf{or} any student. In all cases an active account is also required.
