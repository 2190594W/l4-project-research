For the sake of the scenario, the Programming Languages course was selected with Course Code 4016 to show the creation of a policy.

    Case Study \#3 policy dictating access to a work-in-progress exam script for course `4016'.
  }
\end{figure}
Applying the identified attributes for Case Study \#3 provides the policy in \Cref{fig:case_study_policy_3} which would have been embedded in the encrypted exam script by the Lecturer before upload. The encrypted exam script can then remain stored on the server but would only be the Lecturer themselves (with username `odardha'), as well as the specified collaborators (with usernames `sgay' \& `jodonnell').

Further access would be granted to staff members in the `Professional, Administrative \& Support' field that specifically have the `Administration' role, as well as `Research \& Teaching' staff members that belong to the `FATA' research group and the `Programming Languages' research theme. Lastly, access would be granted to members of staff with the `Marker' role that have been assigned to the `4016' course and will be actively marking during the marking period (`12/05/20\textemdash10/06/20'). In all cases an active account is also required.
