\section{Formal Language Definition}
\label{sec:formal_lang}

We offer the following formal language definition for the resource server's Attribute-Based Encryption policy language, \thePolicyLang. The language was designed around the Case Studies described in \cref{sec:analysis_case_studies} and follows an extensible design principle that aims to provide a complete policy solution for the Department of Computing Science.\\
\thePolicyLang directly provides the tools for policies to be constructed for the \cref{sec:analysis_case_studies} Case Studies, which can then be interpreted to the policy format that the PyOpenABE python bindings (described in \cref{sec:bkgr_openabe}) require.

\thePolicyLang offers boolean comparisons for integer, string \& date attributes with further support for lists of multiple values. Additional comparison operations are provided for integer and date comparisons with `greater than', `less than' and `equivalent to' all supported, whereas booleans, strings and lists support `equivalent to' operations only.\\
This allows for integer comparisons such as ``\textit{studentLevel(\textbf{s}) $\geq$ 4}'' (as found in Case Study \#2, \cref{fig:case_study_policy_2}) and date comparisons such as ``\textit{classRepFrom(\textbf{s}) $\geq$ 17 Sep 2019}'' (as found in Case Study \#5, \cref{fig:case_study_policy_5}). String equivalence operations allow for comparisons such as ``\textit{jobField(\textbf{s}) $\equiv$ `Research \& Teaching'}'' (as found in Case Study \#1, \cref{fig:case_study_policy_1}).\\
List equivalence operations are also supported, allowing for comparisons such as ``\textit{enrolledCourses(\textbf{s}) $\equiv$ [1001, 1017]}'' (as found in Case Study \#2 \cref{fig:case_study_policy_2}) where the policy requires both that `\textit{enrolledCourses(\textbf{s})}' resolves to a list and that that list contains the elements in `\textit{[1001, 1017]}'.
