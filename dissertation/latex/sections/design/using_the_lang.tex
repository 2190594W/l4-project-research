\section{Implementing Policies with \thePolicyLang}
\label{sec:design_impl_pol_lang}

We present three policies created with \thePolicyLang for three of the six Case Studies described in \Cref{sec:analysis_case_studies}. Case Studies \#1, \#3 \& \#5 are presented here, with the remaining Case Studies presenting as Appendices (\Cref{appendix:case_study_0_policy}, \Cref{appendix:case_study_2_policy} \& \Cref{appendix:case_study_4_policy}).
