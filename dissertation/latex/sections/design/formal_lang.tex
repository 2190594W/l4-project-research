\section{Formal Language Definition}
\label{sec:formal_lang}

We offer the following formal language definition for the \theResServer system's \acrfull{abe} policy language, \thePolicyLang. The language is designed around the Case Studies described in \Cref{sec:analysis_case_studies} and follows an extensible design principle that aims to provide a complete policy solution for the \acrfull{dcs}.

\thePolicyLang allows for policies to be constructed for the \Cref{sec:analysis_case_studies} Case Studies, which can then be interpreted to the policy format that the \PyOpenABE python bindings (described in \Cref{sec:bkgr_openabe}) require.

\thePolicyLang offers Boolean comparisons for Integer, String \& Date attributes with further support for Lists of multiple values. Additional comparison operations are provided for Integer and Date comparisons with `greater than', `less than' and `equivalent to' all supported, whereas Booleans, Strings and Lists support `equivalent to' operations only.

This allows for Integer comparisons such as ``\textit{studentLevel(\textbf{s}) $\geq$ 4}'' (as found in Case Study \#2, \Cref{fig:case_study_policy_2}) and Date comparisons such as ``\textit{classRepFrom(\textbf{s}) $\geq$ 17 Sep 2019}'' (as found in Case Study \#5, \Cref{fig:case_study_policy_5}). String equivalence operations allow for comparisons such as ``\textit{jobField(\textbf{s}) $\equiv$ `Research \& Teaching'}'' (as found in Case Study \#1, \Cref{fig:case_study_policy_1}).

List equivalence operations are also supported, allowing for comparisons such as ``\textit{enrolledCourses(\textbf{s}) $\equiv$ [1001, 1017]}'' (as found in Case Study \#2 \Cref{fig:case_study_policy_2}) where the policy requires both that `\textit{enrolledCourses(\textbf{s})}' resolves to a list and that that list contains the elements in `\textit{[1001, 1017]}'.
