February 28th Meeting Minutes

Talked about presentation, need to produce MVP in presentation.
	4-5 slides for 5-7 minutes of talking
		skip over encryption etc
		just sell the product
	practice intro well
		rest of presentation can flow freely off of speaker notes
	slides for myself not for audience
		should be there to support me telling a story
		could go with minimal text, more diagrams

Annex C & D of ISO 27005:2008
	Go through list of the vulnerabilities and threats and validate if they are plausible for each asset

We can make assumptions for risk assessment:
	we may assume devices are up to date and secure
	buildings are secure
		rooms are secure
	servers are secure and up to date
		we are not considering the security of the devices or servers themselves
		only potential attacks or leaks
Make the scope of the project VERY clear
	reducing scope allows for 
	a more comprehensive study would be needed for production deployment

Update risk assessment to more clearly discuss:
	 Information/Data 
		Matric Numbers, Financial data, Password Hashes, Logs. . . 
		During enrolment these details need to be protected
			could be attributes in the user key
		Would enrolment staff have been properly trained
	

22/42 of slides

SSO login is out of scope for risk assessment
	in the assessment we donâ€™t consider the process of authentication
		this would be deferred to a later point with SSO login
Define our scope for what an asset actually is

HTTPS is an absolute requirement for production deployment
	SSL certs
	SSL authority

risk of downloading from a malicious resource server
	

Need to look at user processes for asset identification
