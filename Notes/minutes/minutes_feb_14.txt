February 14th Meeting Minutes

ANTLR parsing of policy language would be a very good exercise for dissertation

Implement checking a file’s policy against the user’s attributes (if manageable)

Discussed formal language and general rules for typing.

Went over the differences between constants and values.

Determined that a longer, 2 hour meeting would be helpful next week, Feb 21st.

Further work on LaTeX and markdown formats for the formal language definition by next week.
Decided to start converting markdown to LaTeX for the definition.

Need to flesh out outline further.
