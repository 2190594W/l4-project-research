February 7th Meeting Minutes

Future work for login, SSO, AD etc
	integration
	current auth is basic, and proof-of-concept
	intent would be to integrate auth and shift responsibility

user key is not secure
	risk assessment would identify this as a risk
	intention would be to secure this in the first place
	what are we assuming, what are we allowing
	can we assume the end user is responsible for protecting the user key
	identify known issues
		ones that were solved
		ones we have left
	transfer risk to institution

we have reg/login, it’s just for local use
	in future SSO integration would provide a much better solution
	we can argue the auth is insecure since we are not using SSO

built functionality for CLI encrypting and decrypting
	but haven’t finished it yet due compatibly issues


upload page shouldn’t have policy box ✅

Implement a metadata/header to encrypted binaries to identify them as being encrypted by this toolset
	if the metadata/header is missing, refuse to upload the file or deal with it

encrypt page should say ‘encrypt’ not ‘upload’ for submit button ✅
encrypt_upload should say ‘encrypt & upload’ ✅

consider a policy building tool
	how to communicate the policy language to the end user
	the scope/universe of the attributes
	constructing form would limit client so parsing not so needed

Master Key Server should perhaps push data to Res Server, rather than pulling from MK Server

ANTLR for parsing policy as type checking

Dissemination of info from MK Server through Res Server to CRS Server

Start properly on dissertation and risk assessment
