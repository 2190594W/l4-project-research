November 22nd Meeting Minutes

Discussed syntax across languages.

Discussed UML diagrams -> Class and Object diagrams and discussed the implications of defining attributes through a Java-like Class system.

Check with openABE to compare Policies with their syntax in python.

Add example Subjects, Environments and Resources to Policies with written out proofs that show the examples do or do not work for the policy.

Move to a Markup language for notes, as LaTeX can be too time consuming.

Add primitive types to Attributes and account for them with set-like notation.
