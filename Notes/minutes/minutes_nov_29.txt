November 29th Meeting Minutes

After getting OpenABE to compile correctly, work on getting the PyOpenABE bindings to compile as well.

Next week: Change of meeting date???

For 2 weeks of 3rd to 14th December, start full work on project code.
Aiming to get both the Key Server & Resource Server up and running at least as prototypes. A simple prototype of a Web Server would be good, with some form of ABAC system in use.

Write 2-week status report in advance of progress, aiming to detail what WILL have been achieved.

Using PlantUML:
Class Diagram to build design of the servers -> the architecture and infrastructure.
Sequence Diagram to show flow of information:
	1. Enrollment Sequence
	2. Encryption Sequence
	3. Decryption Sequence

Prioritise with a TODO list for the 2 weeks.

Determine policy decision point???
