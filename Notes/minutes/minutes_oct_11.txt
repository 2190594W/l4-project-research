October 11th Meeting Minutes

Next week is last meeting

What needs modelled? What should be modelled? What can we leave out?
(From Mind Maps)

Teaching (exams, resources, school forums, newsletters, minutes from Head of School meetings etc.)

Use Cases: MoSCoW 

Designing ABE Resource System (theoretical model)
Developing ABE Resource System (software design)

Access Policy nailed down by November 31st. Software begins December 1st.

Start discussing software implementation after Jan’s annual leave.

Students more fine-grained.

Read more papers and lecture slides.

Key distribution, enrolment to be considered. Offline PKG? Online PKG central server?

If offline, then justify it best as possible. Scope, depth, added security.

Could we hook system into Student Centre for Future Work/Deployment discussion, since then we know the user’s courses etc.

Enrolment could be manual, must discuss and explain.
Must decide where encryption and decryption occurs (client vs server); is the end user expected to be capable of CLI commands.

Network Component Diagram of system.
 Use case in natural language to Policy language to actual software implementation.

Plans for 2 week Jan annual leave, present next week.
During leave investigate uses of ABE software.
Email during 2 weeks, on each meeting day; catch up is quicker.
Properly write out Use Cases. Define attributes for some Subjects/Users.
Student persona, Student class rep ??? persona, Lecturer, Head of XXXX, Admin, Technical
Think of use case for each of above (and more), what might they want to upload/download, how would they do it, what attributes might that have and the resource have. Possible other actions than just upload/download.
Consider user evaluation & security evaluation.
