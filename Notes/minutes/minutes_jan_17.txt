Evaluation

Case studies
	- some small enough to easily place throughout report
	- 1 or 2 that are longer and require detailed examination
		- to show off the expressiveness of policy language
	- compare policy language to implementation

Security Eval / Risk Assessment
	1. Identify your scope (avoid deployment)
	2. Identify your assets
		- assets contain assets
		- assets may be physical
	3. For each asset
		- identify vulnerability
		- identify threat
	4. Look at risk
		risk = vulnerability x threat
	5. Analysis
		- accept
		- treat (control)
		- transfer

Security Eval is VITAL to the dissertation. It helps to prove that the engineering is also secure and not just reliant on the mathematical security of the cryptography.



Start writing up what can be written.
